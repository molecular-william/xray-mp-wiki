# Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 5 (mGlu5)

## Overview

Metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) is a Class C G protein-coupled receptor that plays a key role in regulating NMDA receptor activity in the central nervous system. mGlu5 couples via the Gq/11 family of G proteins and is implicated in numerous neurological disorders including fragile X syndrome, Parkinson's disease, anxiety, and chronic pain. The transmembrane domain (TMD) of mGlu5 contains a well-characterized allosteric binding site (the MPEP site) where negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) bind in a deep pocket within the transmembrane helix bundle. Multiple high-resolution crystal structures have been determined using a thermostabilized StaR construct fused with T4-lysozyme in intracellular loop 2. The first TMD structure (PDB 4OO9) established the architecture of class C GPCR transmembrane domains and revealed the conserved ionic lock network.

## Expression and Purification

- **Expression system**: Sf21 insect cells (baculovirus expression vector system)
- **Construct**: mGlu5-StaR TMD construct with N-terminal GP64 signal sequence, residues 569-836 of mGlu5 receptor (TMD only), C-terminal decahistidine tag. The StaR variant contains six thermostabilizing mutations (E579A, N667Y, I669A, G675M, T742A, S753A) located away from the allosteric ligand binding site. The N-terminal extracellular domain (residues 2-568) and unstructured C-terminus (residues 837-1153) were excised. T4-lysozyme was inserted into intracellular loop 2 between Lys678 and Lys679.

## Biological / Functional Insights

### Ionic lock network in class C GPCRs

The mGlu5 structure reveals a conserved ionic lock network in the
transmembrane domain that regulates receptor signaling. Lys665^3.50 in
TM3 forms a salt bridge with Glu770^6.35 in TM6 (2.7 A distance),
analogous to the Arg135^3.50-Glu247^6.30 salt bridge in rhodopsin.
Additionally, Arg668^3.53 is within hydrogen bonding distance of
Ser614 in ICL1 (3.1 A), forming a secondary lock that tethers TM6
to TM3 via ICL1. Disruption of this network through mutation of
Ser613, Glu770^6.35, or Lys665^3.50 to alanine significantly increases
constitutive activity, providing functional evidence for the role of
this network in maintaining the inactive state. The network is highly
conserved across class C GPCRs including mGlu, GABA_A, CaS, and TAS1
receptors.

### Allosteric binding site architecture

The mavoglurant binding pocket is located approximately 8 A from the
receptor surface, spanning ligand positions observed for class A and B
GPCRs. The ligand is oriented with an approximate 30 degree tilt
relative to the TM bundle axis. The 3-methylphenyl ring sits in a
pocket between Ala810^7.40 and Pro655^3.40, bordered by Ile625^2.46,
Gly628^2.49, Ser654^3.39, Ser658^3.43, and Tyr659^3.44. The alkyne
linker traverses a narrow channel between Tyr659^3.44, Ser809^7.39,
Val806^7.36, and Pro655^3.40. The saturated bicyclic ring system sits
within a mainly hydrophobic pocket defined by Val806^7.36, Met802^7.32,
Phe788^6.53, Trp785^6.50, Leu744^5.44, Ile651^3.36, Pro655^3.40, and
Asn747^5.47.

### Class C GPCR transmembrane architecture

Comparison with rhodopsin (PDB 1F88, class A) and CRF1R (PDB 4K5Y,
class B) reveals distinct features of class C GPCR TMD architecture.
TM5 in mGlu5 is positioned approximately 6 A further inward compared
to both rhodopsin and CRF1R, contributing to a narrow entrance to the
allosteric cavity. TM2 in mGlu5 is straighter than class A receptors
but shifted ~2.5 A closer to the central axis due to packing of
highly conserved Tyr629^2.50 against Gly590^1.50. These structural
features provide a model for all class C G-protein-coupled receptors.
